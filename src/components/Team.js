            The collection includes 10,000 uniquely generated cool sheep, each
            with a random background, ears, and other cute attributes. And yes,
            just look how cute they are! But oddly enough, this is not the main
            thing: by buying the NTF card of our little cool sheep, each holder
            receives land assigned to a unique sheep in our Treasure Field! And
            believe us, the name of the land is fully consistent with it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, we will talk about the project for a very long time, but NFT
            cards, giveaways, airdrops and our magic land - the Treasure Field
            with a large number of NFT prizes for our dear holders is not all.
            We want you to understand that behind our project - behind our
            collection, there are people - 3 best friends, proven over the
            years, who are united by one idea, common interests, love of art, a
            sense of beauty and sweetness, a difference of skills that
            complement each other and ultimately our dear sheep. We want you to
            get to know us better, as our primary dream is to create such a
            community where we would like to write good morning with a hot cup
            of coffee in our hands or share our experiences, or, on the
            contrary, provide support.

              Let's get to know each other - let's start with our beloved and
              dear Raven, because she is where it all began. Direct quote: boys,
              I can draw, I love everything cute, and in the end - I love sheep!
              And that's how it all started. So who is Raven? A lover of
              cuteness, a talented artist, a zoo protector, an extraordinary
              person who often dyes her hair. But all this does not prevent her
              from combining a sharp, strong intellect, extraordinary diligence,
              prudence, and the ability to make balanced correct decisions. I
              think if not for her, we would have made a lot of all different
              mistakes.

              Scofield - Imagine a large, stocky, bearded guy with white hair
              who cannot resist a stray kitten running by, who, by the way,
              remains to live with him in the future. Our front-end and back-end
              developer - the main profile is a react, but in general, the
              entire technical part of the project is behind him, and this must
              be given its due, because there is a lot of work here - especially
              alone (so it is better not to disturb him - after all, stroking
              cats and creating some complicated programming stuff takes a lot
              of time). And yes - it's good that no sheep are running around the
              streets - he would have sheltered them too (and Raven would not
              mind ðŸ˜€)

              Deus Vult is the person in charge of public relations so to speak.
              We would call him a marketer - but he doesn't like it, but
              remember - if you saw our project on some social network or
              platform - be it Reddit or Twitter, or many others, you should
              know - this is all this two-meter bearded, endlessly absorbing
              coffee, polite young man, loving history, coffee and old coins.
              And yes, I almost forgot, he also drinks a lot of coffee!
