                  Cool Sheep is a generative collection of NFTs on the Ethereum
                  blockchain. The collection will consist of 10,000 uniquely
                  generated cool sheep, each with a random background, ears, and
                  other cute attributes. And yes, just look how cute they are!
                  But oddly enough, this is not the main thing: by buying the
                  NTF card of our little cool sheep, each holder receives land
                  assigned to a unique sheep in our Treasure Field! And believe
                  us, the name of the land is fully consistent with it!

                  NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of
                  unique items. They let us tokenise things like art,
                  collectibles, even real estate. They can only have one
                  official owner at a time and they're secured by the Ethereum
                  blockchain – no one can modify the record of ownership or
                  copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

                  Great question! First, you must have a Metamask wallet. Let's
                  immediately answer the question of what it is: MetaMask is an
                  Ethereum based browser that you can use to interact with the
                  blockchain. It is free to use and very easy to download and
                  install. Learn more about Metamask here https://metamask.io/
                  After that, you need to go to our official website, connect
                  your wallet and press the mint button! Having a wallet gives
                  you an Ethereum address, this is where your NFT will be
                  stored.

                  Quite simple actually! The first 300 users who have joined the
                  discord server will be added to the whitelist - early support.
                  Other users can win a place on the white list by participating
                  in contests, giveaways, or actively participating in the
                  social life of the project! Everyone's support is very
                  important to us!

                  Decentralized autonomous organization. You should think about
                  it as a democratic voting system within the blockchain. We are
                  planning to use this system in progressing the project Based
                  on the feedback and discussions of our members in social
                  networks and chats, we will adjust the development of the
                  project. We are going to add new social mechanics and change
